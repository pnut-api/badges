# Pnut Badges

Badges on Pnut show verified "achievements" for users who are supporting Pnut (https://pnut.io/docs/resources/sign-up).

This repository contains a JSON file of all achievable badges, and explanations for attaining them.

## How to contribute

Create an issue or submit a pull request with the elements of a new badge:

* name
* category
* what it means / what is required to attain it

## Usage

Developers may include this repository, call `GET /badges`, or store badge variables statically in their app. Badges do not update frequently, so any of those methods is reasonable.

Do not use custom names for badges.

You may use placeholder graphics for badges.
